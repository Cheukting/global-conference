## The Event

Support PyLadies as we work to improve diversity by bringing fresh talent into
the Python community and to support both seasoned and budding developers
through workshops, community activities, and local advocacy.

Supporting our first global conference will help PyLadies provide financial
support to help more women around the world with training, mentorship, and aid
to attend conferences and community events.
